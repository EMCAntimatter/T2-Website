<p><em><strong>Incident Command Systems for Public Works – 10 Safety</strong></em></p>
<p><em>DHS/FEMA guidelines suggest that Incident Command Systems (ICS) 100 be presented to all first responders, ICS 200 to responders &amp; front-line supervisors, and ICS 300 and ICS 400 to Command &amp; General Staff positions within the ICS structure that would be activated &amp; filled during an actual event/incident.</em></p>
<p><em>The majority of first responders in local agencies must have ICS 100/200 training in order for the agency to be eligible for DHS/FEMA preparedness grants, including agencies with over 50 members, members of the county sheriff’s departments, and the State Police.</em></p>
<p><em>Public Works are first responders! The following guidance is from Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 (December 17, 2003) when defining first responders: “(d) The term “first responder” refers to those individuals who in the early stages of an incident are responsible for the protection and preservation of life, property, evidence, and the environment, including emergency response providers as defined in section 2 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101), as well as emergency management, public health, clinical care, public works, and other skilled support personnel (such as equipment operators) that provide immediate support services during prevention, response, and recovery operations.”</em></p>
